README v0.1 / 10 March 2018

# Private Internet Access
Private Internet Access is the world's leading consumer VPN service. At Private Internet Access we believe in unfettered access for all, and as a firm supporter of the open source ecosystem we have made the decision to open source our VPN clients. For more information about the PIA service, please visit our website [privateinternetaccess.com](https://privateinternetaccess.com).

# Chrome Web Extension
This repo contains all the code needed to build and run the Private Internet Access Chrome Web Extension. This extension allows a user to access our network of proxies across the world from their web browser. Users can choose a proxy server location and connect to it directly from the extension. Additional privacy and security features include disabling microphone and camera, blocking flash and ip discovery through WebRTC, and can automatically block ads and tracking through PIA MACE™.

Please be advised that connecting to a proxy through our extension only protects traffic from that particular browser and not on applications that may be installed on the operating system itself.

## Getting started
This client allows a user to sign-in to their PIA account and choose a particular proxy server to route all their browser traffic through. The client itself is has additional features such as:
 - Block Adobe flash
 - Block WebRTC IP Detection
 - Block Camera access
 - Block Microphone Access
 - Block Location access
 - Disable Network Prediction
 - Disable SafeBrowsing
 - Disable Third Party Cookies
 - Disable Website Referrer
 - Disable Hyperlink Auditing
 - Remove UTM Parameters
 - PIA MACE™ (block ads, trackers, and malicious content)
 - Allow direct connections for whitelisted sites

## Usage
Please start by ensuring that all the requirements in the [Requirements](#requirements) section of this README is installed.

Building the client is as simple as running the build command:

 `browser=chrome build=debug grunt`

 The unpacked extension can be installed from the following url in chrome:

 `chrome://extensions/`

 For detailed instructions please refer to the [Installation](#installation) section.

## Installation

### Requirements
 - Git (latest)
 - Ruby 2.4.1
 - NodeJS 8.1.0 or greater
 - Chrome Web Browser (support for the latest two versions)

Please use these instructions to install Git on your computer if it is not already installed: [Installing Git](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03)

We recommend using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to install ruby on MacOS or using the [ruby installer](https://rubyinstaller.org/) for windows. Ruby can be installed on linux using your built in package manager.

We recommend installing NodeJS via [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) on MacOS and Linux. On Windows, you can simply use the node installer found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

#### Download Codebase
Using the terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/pia-foss/extension-chrome.git`

or use a graphical interface like [Git Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to download this repository into a directory of your choosing.

#### Setup
The extension uses Ruby and NodeJS to build itself and run automated tests.
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) is used instead of the npm client when managing npm packages.

To install all dependencies the extension needs to build run:
  `./script/setup`

#### Building
To build the extension, run one of the commands below.
When the build is finished `./builds/<build name>` will have been created, and it can be loaded as an unpacked extension in Chrome.

    $ browser=chrome build=debug grunt     # option 1 (a build that makes debugging easier)
    $ browser=chrome build=webstore grunt  # option 2 (a production build, that targets the webstore)

A build can be configured to include the git branch and commit SHA it is being built from
by including gitinfo=yes at command line:

    $ browser=chrome build=webstore gitinfo=yes grunt

The git information is shown on the extension settings page if the build was configured to
include it. By default this feature is turned off but enabled when publishing a QA build
to the webstore.

#### Loading Extension

  * Enter "chrome://extensions" into Chrome's address bar.
  * Tick "Developer Mode" if it isn't already.
  * Click "Load unpacked extension", and choose the path to the build directory.


### Testing
**Ensure that the following environment variables are set before running tests**
**EXTENSION_ID**
**TEST_USERNAME**
**TEST_PASSWORD**

There are feature specs written in Ruby ("./spec/features").
To run these specs, "chromedriver" needs to be installed and available on $PATH.
On OSX this can be done with:

    $ brew install chromedriver

And then running all the specs:

    $ rake

Or just one spec file:

    $ rspec spec/features/extension_settings_page_spec.rb

By default the specs target the `webstore` build but you can set $build to change
that:

    $ build=debug rake
    $ build=debug rspec spec/features/...

### Translations

**Ensure that a `config/oneskyauthfile.json` exist before uploading translations. This file should contain the public and secret keys for your 1sky account**
**Ensure that the ONESKY_PROJECT_ID environment variable is set**

The extension supports all locales found in `src/_locales`. The translations are
translated by the 1sky service. `src/_locales/en/messages.json` can be uploaded to 1sky
using the following grunt task:

    $ grunt oneskyImport

Translations for all locales can be downloaded with the following task:

    $ grunt oneskyExport

### Deployment
#### Deploying to the Chrome Webstore

**Ensure the `webstore.pem` file exists.**
**Ensure the following environment variables are set before uploading to the webstore.**
**WEBSTORE_CLIENT_ID**
**WEBSTORE_CLIENT_SECRET**
**WEBSTORE_REFRESH_TOKEN**
**WEBSTORE_PUBLIC_ID**
**WEBSTORE_INTERNAL_ID**
**SLACK_HOOK**


To publish the extension onto the webstore from the command line for either internal
users(eg QA) or the general public, you can run one of the following:

    # For internal users only
    browser=chrome audience=internal build=webstore grunt release

    # For all users
    browser=chrome audience=public build=webstore grunt release
